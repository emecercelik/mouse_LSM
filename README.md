# mouse_LSM

Uses Liquid State Machine (LSM) to code the inputs which are positions of joints '\n' 
The supervisor signal is the sinusoidals that are hand made for locomotion
A Ridge regression method is used to map the LSM outputs to the linear muscle forces (fit_Wout.py)
In test case the outputs of LSM are used with wout to generate the forces of linear muscles
It is not successful
